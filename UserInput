# Getting (User_Input) in Python

my_name = 'Vence'
your_name = input('Enter your name: ') 
print(f'Hello, {your_name}')

# input function takes in something you want to tell the user or give the user so they know they have to type

age = input('Enter your age: ')
print(f'You have lived for {age * 12} months. ') 

# When you run the code you will get 303030303030303030303030 months. The reasonn for this is because everything that is returned by the input function is a string. So what is age * 12 ----> age+age+age+age+ ok you get the picture lol

# Strings are a set of characters, numbers and symbols with no meaning to the computer - only to humans

age = input('Enter your age: ')
age = int(age)
print(f'You have lived for {age * 12} months. ')

#Lines 16 - 18 can be done a easier way

age = int(input('Enter your age: '))
months = age *12
print(f' You have lived for {months} months. ')

age = int(input('Enter your age: '))
seconds = age * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60
print(f'You have lived for {seconds} seconds ')
